Hello everyone,
This training task no.3 on 1MAC

In this training we will make the form we created in Training 1 interact with a user-generated event, moving the Seekbar, which we will add at the bottom of the screen, and we will also use two new components of the interfaces in the Android system namely Menu and Dialog.
